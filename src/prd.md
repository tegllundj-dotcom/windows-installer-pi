- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with real-time data visualization and live updates

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Technology-focused palette with real-time indicators
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - trust and technology
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate gray (#475569) - professional foundation
- **Accent Color**: Electric green (#10b981) - live data and profitable signals
- **Real-time Indicators**: Pulsing animations for live data, color-coded confidence levels
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, greens indicate profitable patterns and live data
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white): Foreground (dark gray #0f172a)
  - Primary (blue): Foreground (white)
  - Success (green): Foreground (white)
  - Card (light gray): Foreground (dark gray)

### Typography System
