## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, precision, technological sophistication
- **Design Personality**: Professional, cutting-edge, data-driven
- **Visual Metaphors**: Neural networks, data flow, pattern recognition
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with complex data visualization

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Triadic with tech-focused palette
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - trust and technology
- **Secondary Colors**: Slate gray (#475569) - professional foundation
- **Accent Color**: Electric green (#10b981) - success and AI insight
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, greens indicate profitable patterns
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white): Foreground (dark gray #0f172a)
  - Primary (blue): Foreground (white)
  - Success (green): Foreground (white)
  - Card (light gray): Foreground (dark gray)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI elements, JetBrains Mono for data/code
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, data, and body text
- **Font Personality**: Modern, technical, highly readable
- **Which fonts**: Inter (primary), JetBrains Mono (monospace data)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts optimized for screen reading and data display

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Neural network visualizations draw focus, then trading signals
- **White Space Philosophy**: Clean separation between complex data visualizations
- **Grid System**: Dashboard grid with dedicated spaces for charts, models, and controls
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary (model predictions), Secondary (historical data), Tertiary (settings)

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions for data updates, loading animations for model training
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Critical alerts get attention, subtle updates for live data
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional animations that enhance understanding

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple models and large datasets
- **Testing Focus**: Model accuracy, performance metrics, user interface responsiveness
- **Critical Questions**: How to balance model complexity with real-time performance?
